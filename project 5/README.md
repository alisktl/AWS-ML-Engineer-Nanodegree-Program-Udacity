# Project №5: Capstone Proposal
In this capstone project proposal, prior to completing the following **Capstone Project**, we leverage what we’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to author a proposal for solving a problem of our choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. A project proposal encompasses seven key points:
* The project's **domain background** — the field of research where the project is derived;
* A **problem statement** — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
* The **datasets and inputs** — data or inputs being used for the problem;
* A **solution statement** — the solution proposed for the problem given;
* A **benchmark model** — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
* A set of **evaluation metrics** — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
* An outline of the **project design** — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.
