# Project â„–4: Dog Breeds Classification
In this project we learn:
1. use AWS resources efficiently and optimally
2. set up multi-instance training
3. set up auto-scaling for endpoints, so it allows to process requests on multiple instances
4. set up concurrency for lambda functions, so it helps to decrease the latency of a project in a high-traffic situations
5. set up policies to AWS roles
