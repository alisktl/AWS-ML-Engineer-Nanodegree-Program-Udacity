# AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program
## Overview
This repository contains projects from the [AWS ML Engineer Nonodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd189)

This programs consists of these courses:
* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Developing Your First ML Workflow
* Deep Learning Topics within Computer Vision and NLP
* Operationalizing Machine Learning Projects on SageMaker
* CAPSTONE PROJECT: Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers

## Projects
### Project 1 (Introduction to Machine Learning)
In this project we predict Bike Sharing Demand using AutoGluon for model selection and hyperparameters optimization.

### Project 2 (Developing Your First ML Workflow)
In this project we use AWS services to train a model, deploy a model, and use AWS Lambda Functions, Step Functions to compose your model and services into an event-driven application.

### Project 3 (Deep Learning Topics within Computer Vision and NLP)
In this project we predict dog breeds. Here we learn how to finetune a pretrained Deep Learning model, tune hyperparameters and deploy model with best hyperparameters.
